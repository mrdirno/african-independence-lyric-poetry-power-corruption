## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a poem composed by Kwame in Chapter 5, full of fire and liberation, and then write his internal monologue re-reading it as an older, entrenched leader in Chapter 17.
- Draft the secret, unvarnished minutes of the Executive meeting in the Jamestown community centre (Ch 1/2), contrasting the public myth of unity.
- Narrate a day in the life of a common market trader in Accra, comparing the promises of 'The Speech' to the reality of price controls and secret police (Ch 10-16).
- Write Komla's private journal entry the night he realizes his friend, the visionary, has become the thing they fought against.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Corruption of Text' visualizer that takes the lyrical, hopeful text of early independence speeches and gradually overlays/strikes through it with the harsh, legalistic text of later decrees and prison orders.
- Create an interactive map of Accra tracking the geographical and psychological distance between key locations: the Jamestown community centre, the Arena, Flagstaff House, and the new prison.
